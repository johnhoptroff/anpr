# anpr
make files for raspian
Convenient downloadable resource for getting ALPR to work on raspberry pi
By default there is an error in the raspberry pi download where probably the bindings have
become a different version to the main executable.  
Instructions:  First run the main script:makeAlpr.sh, then go to the python bindings directory in the /scr folder
and run the make.sh script.
The test.py code will run from the /src folder but will not run from ~/ - I dont know why??!!
